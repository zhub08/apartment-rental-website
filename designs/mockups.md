# Mockups

This file contains the mockups for the website. Mockups are high-fidelity, full-color designs that represent the final look and feel of the application.

**Instructions:**

Once the wireframes are complete, use a tool like Figma or Sketch to create detailed mockups for each page. These mockups should include:

- Color scheme
- Typography
- Spacing and layout
- Final design elements

The mockups will serve as the visual guide for the front-end development phase.
