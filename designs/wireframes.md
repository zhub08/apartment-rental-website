# Wireframes

This file contains the wireframes for the website. Wireframes are simple, black-and-white layouts that focus on the placement of information and functionality.

**Instructions:**

Before proceeding with development, please create wireframes for the following pages:

- Homepage
- Listings Page (including search and filter controls)
- Listing Detail Page

You can use a tool like Balsamiq, or even just a pen and paper, to create these. Once you are happy with the layouts, you can move on to creating high-fidelity mockups.
