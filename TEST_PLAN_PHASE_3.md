  4. `TEST_PLAN_PHASE_3.md` (The Quality Assurance Plan)

   * Purpose: This file contains a detailed, step-by-step plan for testing the features we
     build in the current phase. It ensures that new functionality works as expected and
     doesn't break anything else.
   * How to Use It: After a feature is developed (like the Redis OTP migration), we will
     execute the relevant test cases from this file to verify its correctness.
   * Current Status: It contains the test cases we will run after the OTP migration is
     complete.
